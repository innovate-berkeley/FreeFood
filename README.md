**README**

Hello interested user, welcome to the FreeFood readme.
This project was designed to minimize the enormous food waste Berkeley produces
by utilizing the inexhaustible appetite of the average college student.

FreeFood is a lightweight, SMS based application that alerts subscribers to
extra food being given away near them. Pretty simple, huh.
